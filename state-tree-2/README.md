state-tree
==========

Rescript+React version of the example from Chapter 6 of 
Learning React, 2nd edition, section "State in Component Trees"
with the changes in the section "Sending interactions back up a component tree".

The user can remove colors, and can change the rating for each color. 
State is kept in the root component (App) and the state and functions to 
handle events are passed down the component tree.
